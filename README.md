SSE Toy
-------

Simple SSE client & server, to get you (me) started. Makes use of
[Yaffle's EventSource](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource) polyfill. To run, make sure you have
node, npm and bower (the latter is just an `npm install -g bower` away). Then `cd` into the `sse-toy`
directory and

```
npm install
bower install
node server.js
```

Point browser(s) to `localhost:3333` and watch the mesmerising `tick` events.
